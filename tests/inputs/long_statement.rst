Long statement

.. theorem::

   This is the statement of a very very long theorem and it takes longer than a single
   line i.e. it contains a newline because it is so very long.

.. proof::

   :step: And this is a proof step that has a lot of line breaks. And this is a proof
          step that has a lot of line breaks. And this is a proof step that has a lot of
          line breaks. And this is a proof step that has a lot of line breaks.


.. theorem::

   This once again is the statement of a theorem and it takes longer than a single line
   i.e. it contains a newline because it is so very long.

.. proof::

   :step: And this is a proof step that has a lot of line breaks. And this is a proof
          step that has a lot of line breaks. And this is a proof step that has a lot of
          line breaks. And this is a proof step that has a lot of line breaks.

      :p: Finally we have the proof of the sole step of this proof, and it also happens
          to be very long.  Also, it should be indented and show two handrails.
