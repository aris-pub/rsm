"""Asset resolution protocol and implementations for RSM.

This module provides a protocol-based dependency injection system for asset loading,
allowing external callers to provide custom asset loading logic while keeping the
current disk-based behavior as the default.

Technical Debt Note:
This implementation creates an architectural inconsistency where the main RSM source
file is read from disk via the Reader class, but assets are read via the AssetResolver
system. This should be unified in future refactoring to have consistent file access
patterns across the entire RSM package.
