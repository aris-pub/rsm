Syntax guide
============

WIP.


..
   Base language
   *************

   Every RSM file starts with the string ``:rsm:`` and ends with the double colon
   ``::``.  The double colon is referred to as `Halmos
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_(typography)>`_.

   .. code-block:: text

      :rsm:
      Hello, RSM!
      ::

   The base language contains one special character (the colon ``:``), three types of
   *tags*, and only a handful of syntax rules.


   Tags
   ----

   One of the main goals of RSM is to separate your manuscript's content from the look and
   feel.  Accordingly, RSM provides *semantic tags* that annotate the contents of your
   manuscript.  A tag has the form ``:tag-name: <contents> ::``.  As mentioned above, every
   RSM manuscript starts with the ``:rsm:`` tag and ends with the Halmos ``::``.
   The entire contents of your manuscript are the contents of the ``:rsm:`` tag.

   Tags being semantic means that a tag determines what its contents *are*, not what they
   should look like.  Two parts of your manuscript may be annotated with the same tag but
   end up looking differently in the final output.  Later on we will see examples of this.

   You can think of the Halmos ``::`` as the *empty* tag.  With few exceptions, every
   region of text annotated with a tag always ends with a Halmos.


   Types of tags
   -------------

   There are three different types of tags in RSM: block, inline, and meta.  If you are
   familiar with HTML, blocks and inlines work in RSM much the same way as block and inline
   elements in HTML, whereas meta tags are similar in some respects to HTML attributes.

   Block and inline tags are meant to carry content.  The content may be text or other
   tags.  Meta tags are special in that they associate metadata to the immediately
   enclosing tag.  Consider this example

   .. code-block:: text

      :rsm:
	 :title: Three types of tags.

      Hello, RSM!

      ::

   Here the role of the ``:title:`` tag is to associate the title ``Three types of tags``
   to the enclosing ``:rsm:`` tag.  This tells RSM that the given title is a
   property of the contents of the ``:rsm:`` tag, i.e. a property of the entire
   manuscript.  We say the ``:title:`` is a *meta key* for the enclosing ``:rsm:``
   tag, while the title ``Three types of tags`` is the *meta value* of said key.  Meta tags
   always come in key-values pairs.

   In the previous example, the ``:title:`` meta tag had a visible effect on the output
   manuscript, namely it made the main title appear in the output.  Some meta tags do not
   have a visible output.  For example,

   .. code-block:: text

      :rsm:
	 :title: Three types of tags.

      :section:
	:title: First section
	:label: first-sec

      This section has a label.

      ::

      ::

   We have added a section within the manuscript, using the block tag ``:section:``.  This
   tag has two meta tags: ``:title:``, which works in much the same way as the manuscript's
   title, and a new meta tag ``:label:``, whose value is ``first-sec``.  This tag has no
   visible effect on the output, but it has huge importance to the internal structure of
   the manuscript.  In particular, the label of a tag is a unique identifier that allows
   you to refer to it later on.  For example,

   .. code-block:: text

      :rsm:
	 :title: Three types of tags.

      :section:
	:title: First section
	:label: first-sec

      This section has a label.

      ::

      We can now refer back to the :ref:first-sec::.

      ::


   Syntax rules
   ------------

   Foo bar


   Tags can be one of two main types: *blocks* or *inlines*.  They are differentiated by
   the syntax used to introduce them:

   .. grid:: 1 2 2 2

     .. grid-item-card:: Blocks

	.. code-block:: text

	   :tag-name:
	     :key: val
	     ...

	   <contents>

	   ::


     .. grid-item-card:: Inlines

	.. code-block:: text

	   :tag-name: {:key: val, ...}
	   <contents> ::

   Here the ellipsis denote an arbitrary number of additional key-value pairs.  In general,
   blocks introduce a part of the manuscript that should be regarded as completely separate
   from all other parts, while inlines denote a region of text that is part of the
   enclosing part.

   The third type of tag is *meta* tags.  They are the tags used above to modify their
   parent tags via key-value pairs.
