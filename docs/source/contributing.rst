============

RSM is built by scientists for scientists.  We accept any and all contributions.  No
contribution is too small.


Asking a question
*****************

First, search the `discussion forum <https://github.com/leotrs/rsm/discussions>`_ for
similar questions.  If you are certain no one has asked a related question, `start a new
discussion <https://github.com/leotrs/rsm/discussions/new>`_.


Requesting a feature

After searching the `discussion forum <https://github.com/leotrs/rsm/discussions>`_,
feel free to `open a new thread <https://github.com/leotrs/rsm/discussions/new>`_
requesting a new feature.  Please provide detail about the intended use case.


Filing a bug
************

`Open an issue <https://github.com/leotrs/rsm/issues/new>`_ in the repo.  Please only
open an issue if you are certain you have encountered a (reproducible) bug.  Otherwise,

We can always use help writing documentation.  Currently the best way to do this is by
submitting a PR.
